Torrey Zaches Lab section 6pm. Program 3 RCopy Submission

Submitted before Sunday, 5-25, so eligible for extra credit! :)

Since it was not specified how we should distinguish between an FNAME_OK and FNAME_BAD, I am using the flag for
file response=9, and am indicating if the file name is ok or not with a one byte payload, where OK=9, bad=10.

I use Prof. Smith's Poll API for both programs. Client program (rcopy) uses clientSlidingWindow.h/c for its windowing
API, and server program uses the serverSlidingWindow.h/c for its windowing API.

Per the instructions. Rcopy sends the last packet to the server, so if this packet is lost the server will go to a
timeout trying to retransmit whatever packet it needed the RR for 10 times before quiting.

The client will restart its sequence number when it tries to re-initiate the filename request after not getting a  response,
the the SeqNo report for client isn't always 1-1. (the total will be the number fails recieving FNAME_OK larger than the
unique) I think this makes sense, and I dont see anywhere that specifies if we need to program specifically to make it 1-1.
The server of couse, will only have a SeqNo report be 1-1 if there are no errors, and no out of order messages.
